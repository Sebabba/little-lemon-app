          We are a family owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional
          recipes served with a modern twist. Located in the heart of Chicago,
          we bring together the rich flavors and timeless techniques of the
          Mediterranean with contemporary culinary creativity. Our menu features a
          variety of carefully crafted dishes — from tender lamb and fresh seafood
          to vibrant mezze and house-made breads — all prepared using the finest
          locally sourced ingredients. Each plate reflects our commitment to quality
          and authenticity, while embracing innovation that excites the palate.
